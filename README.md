# Genshin Impact Wish Simulator

### This is a somewhat complete text-based(terminal) Genshin Impact Wish Simulator made 100% in Python. It contains: 
* Ability to wish in four different banners = Standard Banner / Tartaglia Rerun Banner / Zhongi Rerun Banner / Everything Banner
* Can pull (1) Single Pull or (10) Ten Pull
* Inventory System
* Pity System for each banner
* Pull percentages almost 100% similar to the ones in-game
* Soft Pity and Hard Pity are available


## How To Use
Type ***1*** for a single pull. | Type ***10*** for a ten pull.

Type ***inv*** to see your inventory.

Type ***pity*** to see the current pity of your current banner.

Type ***q*** to quit. Note: Your inventory *will not* be saved.

Type ***help*** or ***more*** for more help and instructions.

## Notes
I am relatively new to Python. I love Genshin Impact so I tried to make a wish simulator to satisfy my addiction of wishing. 
As a begginer, there is a lot I can do to compress the writed code, but for now (v1) this will do. I will make more classes and functions in future updates as my
skills grow.
