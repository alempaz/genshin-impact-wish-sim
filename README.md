# Genshin Impact Wish Simulator

### This is a somewhat complete text-based(terminal) Genshin Impact Wish Simulator made 100% in Python. It contains: 
* Ability to wish in eight different banners = Standard Banner / Tartaglia Rerun Banner / Zhongi Rerun Banner / Eula Banner / Klee Rerun Banner / Kazuha Banner / Ayaka Banner / Everything Banner.
* Can pull (1) Single Pull or (10) Ten Pull.
* Inventory System.
* Pity System.
* Shows the amount of pulls made for each banner.
* Pull percentages almost 100% similar to the ones in-game.
* Soft Pity and Hard Pity system.


## How To Use
* Type ***1*** for a single pull. | Type ***10*** for a ten pull.

* Type ***inv*** to see your inventory.

* Type ***pity*** to see the current pity of your current banner + total amount of pulls made in current banner.

* Type the banner name to change to that banner:
  * ***childe_re*** = Childe Rerun Banner
  * ***zhongli_re*** = Zhongli Rerun Banner
  * ***eula*** = Eula Banner
  * ***klee_re*** = Klee Rerun Banner
  * ***kazuha*** = Kazuha Rerun Banner
  * ***ayaka*** = Kamisato Ayaka Banner
  * ***yoimiya*** = Yoimiya Banner
  * ***standard*** = Standard Banner
  * ***everything*** = Every Character and Weapon Banner

* Type ***q*** to quit. Note: Your inventory *will not* be saved.

* Type ***help*** or ***more*** for more help and instructions.

## Notes
Pity system works as in-game. Promotional Banners (Childe, Zhongli, Eula, Klee, Kazuha and Ayaka) have a unified pity. Standard and Everything Banner have individual pity systems.

Everything Banner is an original banner that contains every character and weapon in-game.

Inventory System is not saved after leaving the Simulator.

## Future patches
-- Will continue to update with new banners.

-- Will add old banners.

-- Will add an ability to reset pity inside the Simulator.

-- Will add Weapon banners.
